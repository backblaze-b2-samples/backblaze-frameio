This is a Docker version of the Lambda functions to 'Archive to Backblaze' from frame.io

We specifically tested the container using Rising Cloud as a web service, but it should run on any container platform. 

If using Rising Cloud, please override the default autoscaling and set a minimum of '1' worker to be ready to serve requests. You will also want to set the 'Expose Port' to 8675.

You need to set 5 environment variables in the container environment:

FRAMEIO_TOKEN = The frame.io developer token you obtain from https://developer.frame.io/app/tokens
BUCKET_ENDPOINT = Your Backblaze B2 S3-compatible endpoint, in the form s3.REGION.backblazeb2.com
BUCKET_NAME = Your Backblaze B2 bucket name
ACCESS_KEY = Your Backblaze B2 access key - it is strongly recommended this is unique for this app
SECRET_KEY = Your Backblaze B2 secret key - it is strongly recommended this is unique for this app
